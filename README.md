# Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow

This project is based on the guided project titled **"Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow"**, available on Coursera. The content, methodology, and implementation in this repository are adapted and followed as per the instructions in the Coursera project.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification tasks using TensorFlow. It covers the process of:

1. Preparing and preprocessing textual data.
2. Tokenizing inputs using the BERT tokenizer.
3. Fine-tuning the BERT model on a labeled dataset.
4. Evaluating model performance on a test dataset.

## Project Content
The repository includes:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the step-by-step implementation of fine-tuning BERT for text classification.
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing techniques used for text data.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuning the BERT model using TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating model accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:

   ```bash
